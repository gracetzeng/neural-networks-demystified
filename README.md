# neural-networks-demystified
My personal notes and code while following Welch Lab's neural network video series! This series provides an intuitive and hands-on introduction to the foundations of neural networks, and I had a fun time deriving equations, and implementing concepts, and gaining a deeper (no pun intended) understanding of neural networks.

The main notebook file is divided into 7 parts, as is the series. Each part includes my notes on the episodes and their corresponding code implementations. I used Python along with NumPy for array manipulation and matrix calculations, matplotlib to visualize functions and the model, and SciPy for training.
